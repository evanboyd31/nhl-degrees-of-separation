# NHL Degrees of Separation 🕸️🏒

An interactive discovery engine that finds the connection between every NHL player ever using shared teammates.

## Introduction

Every era of the NHL is distinct, but every player is connected. Inspired by Wayne Gretzky's book "99: Stories of the Game", I built this graph-based search engine to discover the connections between every player to ever play in the NHL from 1917 to present day.
